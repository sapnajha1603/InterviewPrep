Question: Web Scraping with Python

Task: Write a Python script to scrape the titles and URLs of the latest articles from a news website (e.g., BBC, CNN, or any other site of your choice) and save them to a CSV file.
Requirements:

    Use the requests library to fetch the webpage's HTML.
    Use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract data.
    Save the extracted titles and URLs into a CSV file.

Would you like to attempt this or need a step-by-step explanation? ðŸ˜Š'''
