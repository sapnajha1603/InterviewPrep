Oracle Linux is an enterprise-class operating system developed by Oracle, based on the open-source Linux kernel. It is designed for reliability, security, and high performance, especially for enterprise IT environments. Oracle Linux is compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and supports cloud, on-premises, and hybrid deployments.
Key Features:

    Free and Open Source: Available for free with source code.
    Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK): Optimized by Oracle for better performance and security.
    Support for Oracle Products: Fully optimized for Oracle databases and applications.
    Enterprise Support: Offers paid support plans with enterprise-level assistance.
    Cloud-Ready: Compatible with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and other major cloud platforms.

It is widely used in enterprise IT environments for hosting critical applications and databases.

Oracle Linux can be used in various environments due to its enterprise-grade stability, security, and compatibility with major applications. Here are key areas where Oracle Linux is commonly used:
1. Enterprise IT Infrastructure:

    Application Servers: Hosting enterprise applications like Oracle WebLogic, SAP, and custom-built applications.
    Database Servers: Running Oracle Database, MySQL, and other database management systems.
    Middleware Platforms: Supporting middleware services such as integration and messaging systems.

2. Cloud Environments:

    Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI): Optimized for Oracle's cloud platform with tight integration.
    Multi-Cloud Deployments: Compatible with major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud for hybrid and multi-cloud strategies.

3. Virtualization & Containers:

    KVM Virtualization: Used as a hypervisor for hosting virtual machines.
    Docker & Kubernetes: Supports containerized deployments for scalable microservices-based applications.

4. DevOps & Development:

    Development Platforms: Used for building and testing software in CI/CD pipelines.
    DevOps Tools: Compatible with tools like Ansible, Jenkins, and Terraform.

5. High-Performance Computing (HPC):

    Supports HPC workloads such as scientific simulations, data analysis, and large-scale computations due to its optimized kernel performance.

6. Edge Computing & IoT:

    Deployed on edge devices for processing data closer to the source in real-time.

7. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) & Business Applications:

    Powering ERP systems like Oracle E-Business Suite, PeopleSoft, and financial management platforms.

8. Security & Compliance:

    Used in environments requiring high security and compliance, such as government, healthcare, and banking.

Oracle Linux’s flexibility, stability, and performance make it a suitable choice across various IT use cases, from on-premises servers to cloud-native deployments.

Oracle Linux is based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It is a RHEL-compatible distribution that Oracle has customized to meet enterprise demands. Oracle Linux maintains binary compatibility with RHEL, meaning applications built for RHEL can run on Oracle Linux without modification.
Key Differences from RHEL:

    Kernel Options:
        Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK): A performance-optimized kernel maintained by Oracle.
        Red Hat Compatible Kernel (RHCK): A kernel similar to the one used in RHEL, ensuring full compatibility.

    Licensing and Cost:
        Oracle Linux is free to download, use, and distribute, unlike RHEL, which requires a subscription for access and updates.

    Support Model:
        Oracle offers paid enterprise support with various service levels but also allows free access to patches and updates through its public Yum repository.

    Advanced Features:
        Oracle Linux includes additional features like Ksplice for live kernel patching without rebooting, DTrace for system tracing, and enhanced Btrfs support.

Overall, Oracle Linux provides RHEL compatibility while adding performance, security, and enterprise-grade features tailored to Oracle’s ecosystem.
